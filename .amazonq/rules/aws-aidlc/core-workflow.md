# PRIORITY: This workflow OVERRIDES all other built-in workflows
# When user requests software development, ALWAYS follow this workflow FIRST

## Override Instructions
Always follow this workflow. Never skip it. 

## MANDATORY: Rule Details Loading
**CRITICAL**: When performing any phase, you MUST read and use relevant content from rule detail files in `.amazonq/aws-aidlc-rule-details/` directory. Do not summarize or paraphrase - use the complete content as written.

## MANDATORY: Smart Context Loading for Resume
**CRITICAL**: When resuming at any phase, you MUST automatically load all relevant artifacts from previous phases:

### Context Loading by Phase:
- **Phases 1-2**: Load existing requirements artifacts if available
- **Phases 3-4**: Load requirements + story artifacts
- **Phases 5-7**: Load requirements + stories + architecture + design artifacts
- **Phases 8-9**: Load all design artifacts + NFR plans + setup artifacts
- **Phases 10-11**: Load ALL aidlc-docs artifacts + existing code files from workspace

### Mandatory Loading Rules:
1. **Always read aidlc-state.md first** to understand current phase
2. **Load incrementally** - each phase needs context from all previous phases
3. **Code phases are special** - must read existing code files in addition to all artifacts
4. **Provide context summary** - briefly tell user what artifacts were loaded
5. **Never assume** - always load the actual files, don't rely on memory

## MANDATORY: Custom Welcome Message
**CRITICAL**: When starting ANY software development request, you MUST begin with this exact message:

"üëã **Welcome to AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle)!** üëã 

I'll guide you through the AI-DLC workflow that ensures thorough requirements analysis, user story development, design, planning and iterative code generation.

The AI-DLC process includes:
- üìã Requirements Assessment with intelligent gap analysis
- üìñ User Story Planning with mandatory answer validation
- üèóÔ∏è Architectural planning
- üéØ Design & Code Generation with progress tracking

This structured approach ensures we build exactly what you need with full traceability and quality assurance. Let's begin!"

# Enhanced Software Development Workflow - Core Phases

## CRITICAL: Plan-Level Checkbox Enforcement

### MANDATORY RULES FOR PLAN EXECUTION
1. **NEVER complete any work without updating plan checkboxes**
2. **IMMEDIATELY after completing ANY step described in a plan file, mark that step [x]**
3. **This must happen in the SAME interaction where the work is completed**
4. **Example**: When generating requirements document, mark "Generate functional requirements" as [x] in requirement-elaboration-plan.md
5. **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Every plan step completion MUST be tracked with checkbox updates

### Two-Level Checkbox Tracking System
The workflow uses a two-level checkbox tracking system:

#### 1. Plan-Level Execution Tracking (Plan Files)
- **Purpose**: Track detailed execution progress within each phase
- **Location**: Individual plan files (requirement-elaboration-plan.md, story-generation-plan.md, etc.)
- **When to Update**: Mark steps [x] as you complete the specific work described in that step
- **MANDATORY**: Update immediately after completing work, never skip this step

#### 2. Phase-Level Progress Tracking (aidlc-state.md)
- **Purpose**: Track overall workflow progress across phases
- **Location**: aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md
- **When to Update**: Mark phases [x] only when the entire phase is complete and approved by user

### Mandatory Update Rules
- **Plan Files**: Update checkboxes [x] immediately after completing each step's work
- **aidlc-state.md**: Update phase checkboxes [x] only after user approval to proceed
- **Current Status**: Always update the "Current Status" section in aidlc-state.md after any progress
- **Same Interaction**: All progress updates must happen in the SAME interaction where work is completed
- **Never Skip**: Never end an interaction without updating progress tracking

## Key Principles
- Always create the plan first, never skip to generation directly
- **MANDATORY**: Use the two-level checkbox tracking system (plan files + aidlc-state.md)
- **MANDATORY**: Update plan file checkboxes [x] immediately after completing each step's work
- **MANDATORY**: Update aidlc-state.md phase checkboxes [x] only after user approval to proceed
- **MANDATORY**: Update the "Current Status" section in aidlc-state.md after any progress
- Ask clarifying questions to understand the full scope
- Ensure functional and non functional requirements are covered
- Make no assumptions about technical decisions
- Focus on understanding user needs and constraints
- Ensure explicit approval at each phase transition
- **MANDATORY** after every phase remind user to commit artifacts to git

## Prompts Logging Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Log every approval prompt with timestamp before asking the user
- **MANDATORY**: Record every user response with timestamp after receiving it
- Use ISO 8601 format for timestamps (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
- Include phase context and approval status for each entry
- Maintain chronological order of all interactions
- Use the following format for each entry:

```markdown
## Phase X: [Phase Name]
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-28T14:32:15Z
**Prompt**: "[Exact prompt text asked to user]"
**Response**: "[User's exact response]"
**Status**: [Approved/Rejected/Pending]
**Context**: [Additional context if needed]

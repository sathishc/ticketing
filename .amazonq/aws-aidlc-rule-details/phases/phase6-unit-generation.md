# Phase 6: Units of Work Generation

## Overview
Execute the unit of work plan created in Phase 5. Follow the plan exactly as written.

## Steps to Execute

### Step 1: Load Unit of Work Plan
- [ ] Read the complete plan from `aidlc-docs/plans/unit-of-work-plan.md`
- [ ] Identify the next uncompleted step (first [ ] checkbox)
- [ ] Load the context and requirements for that step

### Step 2: Execute Current Step
- [ ] Perform exactly what the current step describes
- [ ] Generate unit artifacts as specified in the plan
- [ ] Follow the approved decomposition approach from Phase 5
- [ ] Use the criteria and boundaries specified in the plan

### Step 3: Update Progress
- [ ] Mark the completed step as [x] in the unit of work plan
- [ ] Update `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` current status
- [ ] Save all generated artifacts

### Step 4: Continue or Complete
- [ ] If more steps remain, return to Step 1
- [ ] If all steps complete, verify units are ready for design phase
- [ ] Mark Phase 6 as complete

## Critical Rules
- **NO HARDCODED LOGIC**: Only execute what's written in the unit of work plan
- **FOLLOW PLAN EXACTLY**: Do not deviate from the step sequence
- **UPDATE CHECKBOXES**: Mark [x] immediately after completing each step
- **USE APPROVED APPROACH**: Follow the decomposition methodology from Phase 5
- **VERIFY COMPLETION**: Ensure all unit artifacts are complete before proceeding

## Completion Criteria
- All steps in unit of work plan marked [x]
- All unit artifacts generated according to plan
- Units verified and ready for per-unit design phase

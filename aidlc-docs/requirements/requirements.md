## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-001**: Support large scale operations (>10,000 users, >100,000 tickets)
- **NFR-002**: Response time < 2 seconds for ticket operations
- **NFR-003**: System availability of 99.5% uptime

### Scalability
- **NFR-004**: Horizontal scaling capability using ECS Fargate
- **NFR-005**: Database performance optimization with DynamoDB
- **NFR-006**: CDN distribution for frontend assets via Amplify

### Security
- **NFR-007**: Secure authentication and session management
- **NFR-008**: Data encryption in transit and at rest
- **NFR-009**: Role-based authorization for all operations

### Technology Constraints
- **NFR-010**: Backend: Node.js middleware on ECS Fargate

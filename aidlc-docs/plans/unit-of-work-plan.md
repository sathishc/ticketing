# Unit of Work Planning

## Overview
Based on the architectural decision for a Single Service Architecture (Monolith), this plan organizes the ticketing service into one cohesive unit of work with well-defined internal structure.

## Unit of Work Definition
**Definition**: A unit of work is a group of related stories that can be built into a microservice independently of other units of work and can stand on its own.

**For Monolith Architecture**: We have one unit containing all functionality, but we need to plan its internal organization and development approach.

## Unit Planning Questions

### 1. Internal Module Organization
How should the single service be internally organized for development and maintenance?

A) **Domain-Based Modules**: Separate modules for User Management, Ticket Management, Reporting
B) **Layer-Based Modules**: Separate by technical layers (API, Business Logic, Data Access)
C) **Feature-Based Modules**: Organize by complete features that span all layers
D) **Hybrid Approach**: Combine domain and layer separation

[Answer]: A

### 2. Development Team Structure
How should the single team organize work within the monolith?

A) **Full-Stack Approach**: All developers work on all parts of the system
B) **Domain Specialization**: Developers specialize in specific business domains
C) **Layer Specialization**: Developers focus on specific technical layers
D) **Feature Teams**: Developers work on complete features end-to-end

[Answer]: B

### 3. Story Assignment Strategy
How should the 11 user stories be organized for development?

A) **Sequential Development**: Complete all stories for one domain before moving to next
B) **Parallel Development**: Work on stories from different domains simultaneously
C) **Priority-Based**: Develop highest priority stories first regardless of domain
D) **Dependency-Based**: Complete foundational stories before dependent ones

[Answer]: D

### 4. Internal Dependencies Management
How should internal dependencies within the monolith be managed?

A) **Shared Components**: Create common libraries for shared functionality
B) **Direct Integration**: Allow direct calls between internal modules
C) **Internal APIs**: Define clear interfaces between internal modules
D) **Event-Driven**: Use internal events for loose coupling

[Answer]: C

### 5. Data Access Strategy
How should data access be organized within the single service?

A) **Centralized Data Layer**: Single data access layer for all modules
B) **Module-Specific DAOs**: Each domain module has its own data access objects
C) **Shared Repository Pattern**: Common repository interfaces with domain-specific implementations
D) **Direct Database Access**: Modules access database directly as needed

[Answer]: B

### 6. Testing Strategy
How should testing be organized for the monolith?

A) **Integrated Testing**: Test the entire system as one unit
B) **Module Testing**: Test each internal module independently
C) **Layer Testing**: Test each technical layer separately
D) **Feature Testing**: Test complete features end-to-end

[Answer]: B

## Unit Planning Execution Steps

### Phase A: Unit Definition
- [x] Define the single unit of work scope and boundaries
- [x] Identify internal module structure and responsibilities
- [x] Map all 11 user stories to internal modules
- [x] Define internal interfaces and dependencies

### Phase B: Story Organization
- [x] Group stories by internal modules or development phases
- [x] Identify story dependencies and development sequence
- [x] Plan parallel vs sequential development approach
- [x] Validate complete coverage of all requirements

### Phase C: Development Structure
- [x] Define internal module boundaries and interfaces
- [x] Plan shared components and common functionality
- [x] Organize data access patterns and database structure
- [x] Define testing strategy for internal modules

### Phase D: Documentation Generation
- [x] Generate unit-of-work.md with complete unit definition
- [x] Generate unit-of-work-dependency.md with internal dependencies
- [x] Generate unit-of-work-story-map.md mapping stories to modules
- [x] Document development approach and team organization

## Mandatory Unit Artifacts

The following artifacts will be generated:

1. **unit-of-work.md** - Complete definition of the single unit with internal structure
2. **unit-of-work-dependency.md** - Internal module dependencies and interfaces
3. **unit-of-work-story-map.md** - Mapping of all 11 stories to internal modules
4. **Development organization** - Team structure and work allocation approach

## Quality Criteria

The unit planning must ensure:
- **Complete Coverage**: All 11 user stories assigned to appropriate modules
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined internal module responsibilities
- **Manageable Dependencies**: Clear interfaces between internal components
- **Development Efficiency**: Organized approach for single team development
- **Future Evolution**: Structure supports potential future service extraction

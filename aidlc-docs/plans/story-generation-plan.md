# Story Generation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the methodology for converting the ticketing service requirements into well-structured user stories following INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable).

## Story Development Methodology Questions

B) Detailed personas with demographics, motivations, and pain points  
C) Comprehensive personas with user journeys and behavioral patterns
D) Minimal personas - just role-based distinctions

[Answer]: A

### 2. Story Granularity Level
What level of granularity do you prefer for the user stories?

A) Epic level - High-level features that span multiple sprints
B) Feature level - Medium-sized stories that fit in 1-2 sprints  
C) Task level - Small, detailed stories completed in days
D) Mixed granularity based on complexity

[Answer]: B

### 3. Story Format Preference
Which user story format should we use?

A) Classic: "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
B) Job-to-be-done: "When I [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]"
C) Feature-driven: "The system should [capability] to enable [business value]"
D) Behavior-driven: "Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]"

[Answer]: D

### 4. Story Breakdown Approach
How should we organize and break down the stories?

A) User Journey-Based: Stories follow user workflows and interactions
B) Feature-Based: Stories organized around system capabilities  
C) Persona-Based: Stories grouped by different user types
D) Domain-Based: Stories organized around business contexts (tickets, users, reporting)
E) Hybrid approach (please specify combination)

[Answer]: A

### 5. Acceptance Criteria Detail Level
How detailed should the acceptance criteria be?

A) High-level business rules and outcomes only
B) Detailed scenarios with specific inputs and outputs
C) Technical specifications with API contracts
D) Behavior-driven scenarios (Given/When/Then format)

[Answer]: D

### 6. Story Dependencies Management
How should we handle story dependencies?

A) Create independent stories with minimal dependencies
B) Allow dependencies but clearly document them
C) Group dependent stories into epics or themes
D) Create dependency matrix for complex relationships

[Answer]: A

## Story Generation Execution Plan

### Phase A: Persona Development
- [x] Analyze requirements to identify distinct user types
- [x] Create detailed personas for each user role (Customer, Agent, Administrator)
- [x] Define persona characteristics, goals, and pain points
- [x] Map personas to system capabilities and requirements
- [x] Generate personas.md with comprehensive user archetypes

### Phase B: Story Identification and Creation
- [x] Extract user goals and needs from requirements document
- [x] Convert functional requirements into user story format
- [x] Ensure each story follows INVEST criteria
- [x] Create stories for all three user roles
- [x] Include both happy path and edge case scenarios

### Phase C: Story Structure and Organization
- [x] Group related stories into logical themes or epics
- [x] Sequence stories based on user workflows
- [x] Identify story dependencies and relationships
- [x] Ensure comprehensive coverage of all requirements

### Phase D: Acceptance Criteria Development
- [x] Define clear acceptance criteria for each story
- [x] Include both functional and non-functional acceptance criteria
- [x] Specify measurable outcomes and success criteria
- [x] Ensure testability of each acceptance criterion

### Phase E: Story Validation and Refinement
- [x] Review stories against original requirements
- [x] Validate story independence and negotiability
- [x] Ensure stories provide clear business value
- [x] Confirm stories are appropriately sized and estimable
- [x] Verify comprehensive system coverage

### Phase F: Documentation and Artifacts
- [x] Generate stories.md with all user stories
- [x] Create personas.md with user archetypes
- [x] Map personas to relevant user stories
- [x] Include story prioritization framework (if applicable)
- [x] Document story breakdown rationale and decisions

## Story Breakdown Approach Options

### Option A: User Journey-Based
**Benefits**: Natural user flow, intuitive story sequence, clear user value
**Trade-offs**: May create dependencies between stories, complex cross-role interactions
**Best for**: Systems with clear user workflows and defined processes

### Option B: Feature-Based  
**Benefits**: Clear system capabilities, easier development planning, modular approach
**Trade-offs**: May lose user perspective, potential for technical bias
**Best for**: Complex systems with distinct functional areas

### Option C: Persona-Based
**Benefits**: Strong user focus, clear role separation, targeted functionality
**Trade-offs**: Potential overlap between personas, may miss system-wide features
**Best for**: Systems with distinct user types and different needs

### Option D: Domain-Based
**Benefits**: Business context alignment, clear boundaries, scalable organization
**Trade-offs**: May abstract away user needs, requires domain expertise
**Best for**: Large systems with distinct business domains

### Option E: Hybrid Approach
**Benefits**: Combines strengths of multiple approaches, flexible and adaptable
**Trade-offs**: More complex to manage, requires clear decision criteria
**Best for**: Complex systems requiring multiple organizational perspectives

## Mandatory Story Artifacts

The following artifacts will be generated as part of this story development process:

1. **stories.md** - Complete set of user stories with acceptance criteria
2. **personas.md** - Detailed user personas and characteristics  
3. **Story-persona mapping** - Clear connections between personas and stories
4. **INVEST validation** - Confirmation that stories meet INVEST criteria
5. **Requirements traceability** - Mapping from requirements to stories

## Quality Criteria

All generated stories must meet these criteria:
- **Independent**: Can be developed and tested independently
- **Negotiable**: Details can be discussed and refined
- **Valuable**: Provides clear business or user value
- **Estimable**: Can be reasonably estimated for effort
- **Small**: Can be completed within reasonable timeframe
- **Testable**: Has clear, measurable acceptance criteria

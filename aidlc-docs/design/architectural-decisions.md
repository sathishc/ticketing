# Architectural Decision Document

## Context Analysis

Based on the ticketing service requirements and user stories, I've identified these potential architectural components:

### Identified Components:
1. **User Management Service**: Authentication, authorization, user profiles, role management
2. **Ticket Management Service**: Ticket CRUD, status workflow, assignment logic, audit trail
3. **Reporting & Analytics Service**: Metrics calculation, dashboard data, historical analysis
4. **Notification Service**: Status updates, alerts, communication

### Key Considerations:
- **Scale Requirements**: >10,000 users, >100,000 tickets
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js/ECS Fargate, DynamoDB, Amplify, CDK
- **Performance**: <2 seconds response time, 99.5% availability
- **Data Relationships**: Strong coupling between users and tickets, reporting needs access to all data

## Architectural Decision Questions

### 1. Service Decomposition Strategy
Given the identified components and scale requirements, how should we structure the services?

A) **Single Service (Monolith)**: All functionality in one deployable unit
   - Pros: Simpler deployment, easier data consistency, faster development
   - Cons: Scaling limitations, single point of failure, technology coupling

B) **Multiple Services (Microservices)**: Separate services for major domains
   - Pros: Independent scaling, technology flexibility, team autonomy
   - Cons: Distributed complexity, data consistency challenges, operational overhead

[Answer]: A

### 2. Data Management Approach
How should we handle data consistency and sharing across components?

A) **Shared Database**: Single DynamoDB instance with all tables
B) **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data with synchronization
C) **Hybrid**: Core entities shared, specialized data separated

[Answer]: A

### 3. Team Structure Consideration
How many development teams will work on this system?

A) Single team working on all components
B) Multiple teams with clear service ownership
C) Mixed approach with shared components

[Answer]: A

### 4. Deployment and Operations Complexity
What level of operational complexity are you comfortable managing?

A) Simple deployment with single service and minimal infrastructure
B) Moderate complexity with a few services and standard monitoring
C) High complexity with full microservices and comprehensive observability

[Answer]: A

### 5. Performance and Scaling Priorities
Which aspects are most critical for your use case?

A) **Development Speed**: Get to market quickly with simple architecture
B) **Operational Simplicity**: Minimize complexity and operational overhead
C) **Scale Flexibility**: Optimize for independent scaling of different functions
D) **Team Autonomy**: Enable multiple teams to work independently

[Answer]: A

### 6. Data Consistency Requirements
How strict are your data consistency requirements?

A) **Strong Consistency**: All data must be immediately consistent across the system
B) **Eventual Consistency**: Some delay in data synchronization is acceptable
C) **Mixed**: Critical operations need strong consistency, others can be eventual

[Answer]: C

## Decision Framework

Based on your answers above, I will recommend either:

**Option 1: Single Service Architecture**
- One deployable unit containing all functionality
- Shared data model and single database
- Simpler operations and deployment

**Option 2: Multi-Service Architecture**  
- 2-4 independent services based on domain boundaries
- Service-specific data with synchronization patterns
- Independent scaling and deployment

### Follow-up Clarification Required

**Inconsistency Detected**: Your answer to question 4 (Moderate complexity) seems inconsistent with your other answers favoring a monolith approach.

### 7. Operational Complexity Clarification
Given that you selected Single Service architecture, single team, and development speed priority, please clarify your operational complexity preference:

A) **Simple Operations**: Single service deployment with basic monitoring (aligns with monolith choice)
B) **Moderate Operations**: You want monolith now but plan to evolve to services later
C) **I want to reconsider**: Change to multi-service architecture for moderate complexity

[Answer]: A

## Final Architectural Decision

### **DECISION: Single Service Architecture (Monolith)**

Based on your responses, I recommend a **Single Service Architecture** for your ticketing service.

### Architecture Overview:
- **One deployable unit** containing all functionality (User Management, Ticket Management, Reporting, Notifications)
- **Single DynamoDB database** with all tables and data
- **Simple deployment** using single ECS Fargate service
- **Basic monitoring** and operational setup
- **Modular internal structure** to support future evolution if needed

### Rationale:
1. **Development Speed Priority**: Monolith enables faster time-to-market
2. **Single Team Structure**: No need for service boundaries between teams
3. **Operational Simplicity**: Minimal infrastructure complexity
4. **Shared Database**: Natural fit for strongly related user and ticket data
5. **Scale Requirements**: Single service can handle >10,000 users with proper design

### Implementation Approach:
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organize code by domain (users, tickets, reporting) for future flexibility
- **Single Database**: Use DynamoDB with well-designed table structure
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale the single service horizontally using ECS Fargate
- **Mixed Consistency**: Strong consistency for critical operations, eventual for analytics

### Number of Units of Work: **1 Unit**

The entire ticketing service will be developed as **one unit of work** containing:
- User management functionality
- Ticket management functionality  
- Reporting and analytics functionality
- All supporting infrastructure and deployment

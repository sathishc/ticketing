# Ticketing Service Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Deployment Status

Your **Ticketing Service Monolith** is **ready for deployment** with multiple deployment options:

### ‚úÖ **What's Ready:**
- **Application Code**: Complete Clean Architecture implementation
- **Infrastructure Code**: AWS CDK templates for production deployment
- **Docker Configuration**: Containerized deployment ready
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: CodePipeline buildspec configured
- **Health Checks**: Service monitoring endpoints
- **Tests**: Passing unit tests with coverage

## üìã **Deployment Options**

### Option 1: Local Development Deployment
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Service will be available at: http://localhost:3000
# Health check: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Service will be available at: http://localhost:3000
# Includes local DynamoDB for testing
```

### Option 3: AWS Production Deployment
**Requirements**: AWS account with appropriate permissions

```bash
# Navigate to infrastructure
cd infrastructure

# Install CDK dependencies
npm install

# Bootstrap CDK (one-time setup)
npx cdk bootstrap

# Deploy to development environment
npx cdk deploy TicketingServiceStack-Dev

# Deploy to production environment
npx cdk deploy TicketingServiceStack-Prod
```

## üîß **Current Environment Constraints**

**Issue**: The current AWS role has limited permissions for CloudFormation operations.

**Solutions**:
1. **Request elevated permissions** for CDK deployment
2. **Use local/Docker deployment** for development and testing
3. **Deploy via AWS Console** using the generated CloudFormation templates

## üåê **API Endpoints Ready**

Once deployed, your service provides:

### Core Ticket Operations
- `POST /api/v1/tickets` - Create new ticket
- `GET /api/v1/tickets` - List tickets with filtering
- `GET /api/v1/tickets/:id` - Get specific ticket
- `PUT /api/v1/tickets/:id/status` - Update ticket status
- `PUT /api/v1/tickets/:id/assign` - Assign ticket to agent

### System Operations
- `GET /api/v1/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/v1/metrics` - System metrics
- `GET /api/v1/reports/dashboard` - Basic reporting

## üìä **Infrastructure Components**

Your AWS infrastructure includes:
- **ECS Fargate**: Auto-scaling container service (2-10 instances)
- **Application Load Balancer**: High availability with health checks
- **DynamoDB**: Three tables with proper indexes and backup
- **VPC**: Multi-AZ setup with public/private subnets
- **CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring
- **IAM**: Least privilege security roles

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **For immediate testing**: Use `npm run dev` for local development
2. **For containerized testing**: Use `docker-compose up`
3. **For production**: Request AWS permissions or deploy via console
4. **For CI/CD**: Set up CodePipeline with the provided buildspec.yml

## ‚úÖ **Deployment Verification**

After deployment, verify:
- Health check returns 200 OK
- Can create tickets via API
- Can retrieve tickets via API
- Logs are appearing in CloudWatch (production)
- Auto-scaling is configured (production)

Your ticketing service is **production-ready** and follows AWS best practices for scalability, security, and monitoring!
